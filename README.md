This is a project, which consists of 5 games. You can play each of it.
In all games, knowledge of mathematics will help you.
The first game is to check the parity of a number.
The second game is a calculator. You need to calculate and write the result of the mathematical expression that the game will offer.
Third game - you will be shown two random numbers. You need to calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.
The fourth game - you will be shown a series of numbers, forming an arithmetic progression. One number will be hidden. You need to determine this number.
The fifth game offers a test for the primeness of a number.

You can clone the repository with git@github.com:SovaDekster/python-project-49.git
Or https://github.com/SovaDekster/python-project-49

For this games you will need python = "^3.10" and prompt = "^0.4.1"

Also you can use some helpful commands:

make install - just like poetry install

make build

make publish

make package-install - установка пакета

To start every game you can enter:

brain-even - first game

brain-calc - second game

brain-gcd - third game

brain-progression - fourth game

brain-prime - fifth game
